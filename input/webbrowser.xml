            The scope of the Web Browser PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of web browser applications in terms of [CC] 
            and to define functional and assurance requirements for the product-specific capabilities of web browser applications.
            Web browsers are client applications that retrieve
            and render content provided by web servers, primarily using the hypertext transfer
            protocol (HTTP) or HTTP Secure (HTTPS). 
            
            This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP: <h:ul>
                <h:li>Protection Profile for Application Software, Version 1.3</h:li>
            </h:ul>
            <h:p/> This Base-PP is valid because web browsers are a specific type of software application.

        <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
        The Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this PP-Module is a web browser application running on a desktop or mobile operating system. 
            <h:p/>
        Web browsers are client applications that retrieve
        and render content provided by web servers, primarily using the hypertext transfer
        protocol (HTTP) or HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Browsers have grown in complexity over the
        years, starting as tools used to display simple, unchanging websites and becoming
        sophisticated execution environments for web content. The use of browsers to administer
        accounts, servers, or embedded systems remotely requires them to handle sensitive
        information securely. Innovations such as tabs, extensions, and HTML5 have not only
        increased browser functionality, but also introduced new security concerns. Being the
        principal method for accessing the internet, and due to their complexity and the
        information that they process, browsers are a natural target for attackers. As a result,
        it is paramount that the security of web browsers be improved to reduce the risk to
        client machines and enterprise networks.
            <h:p/> 
            This PP-Module along with the
            Protection Profile for Application Software <xref to="bibAppPP"/> provide a
            baseline set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for web browsers running on any
            operating system regardless of the composition of the underlying platform. The
            requirements are intended to improve the security of browsers by encouraging the use of
            operating system security services and requiring the use of sandboxing technologies and
            environmental mitigations provided by the underlying platform. Additionally, these
            requirements define security functionality that browsers must provide.
            <h:p/>
            The terms web
            browser, browser, and TOE are interchangeable in this document. 
        
        
            <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
                The physical boundary of the web browser is a software application running on a general-purpose operating system. The TOE boundary may include third-party add-ons, but these are non-interfering with respect to security;
                add-ons provide features that are outside the TOE's logical boundary but must be implemented in such a manner that their inclusion does not compromise the security of the TSF.

    <sec:Security_Problem_Description> The security problem is described in
        terms of the threats that the web browser is expected to address, assumptions about the
        operational environment, and any organizational security policies that it is expected to
        enforce. <h:p/> This PP-Module does not repeat the threats, assumptions, and
        organizational security policies identified in the App PP, though they all apply given the
        conformance and hence dependence of this PP-Module on it. Together the threats,
        assumptions and organizational security policies of the App PP and those defined in this
            PP-Module describe those addressed by a web browser as the Target of
        Evaluation. 
        <h:p/> 
        Notably, browsers are particularly at risk from the T.NETWORK_ATTACK threat
        identified in the App PP. Attackers can use phishing or another social engineering technique
        to persuade a user to visit a malicious site. Users may also unintentionally visit malicious
        sites in the course of web browsing. Such sites then present malicious content to the user's
        browser to exploit it and perform installation of malware, often with no indication to the
        user. 
        <sec:Threats>The following threats are specific to web
            browsers, and represent an addition to those identified in the App PP.<threats>
                <threat name="T.FLAWED_ADDON">
                    <description> Web browser functionality can be extended through the integration
                        of third-party utilities and tools. Malicious or vulnerable add-ons could
                        result in attacks against the system. Such attacks can allow unauthorized
                        access to sensitive information in the browser, unauthorized access to the
                        platform's file system, or even privilege escalation that enables
                        unauthorized access to other applications or the operating
                        system.</description>
                    <consistency-rationale>The threat of a user installing a flawed add-on is consistent with the T.LOCAL_ATTACK threat from the Base-PP.
                        A flawed add-on, whether crafted deliberately or unintentionally, could cause the product to operate in a manner where it or its platform can be compromised.</consistency-rationale>
                    <objective-refer ref="O.ADDON_INTEGRITY">
                        <rationale>The threat T.FLAWED_ADDON is countered by O.ADDON_INTEGRITY, which ensures that a conformant TOE either does not support add-ons at all (in which case there is no possibility of

                    <description> Violating the same-origin policy is a specialized type of network
                        attack (covered generally as T.NETWORK_ATTACK in the App PP) which involves
                        web content violating access control policies enforced by a web browser to
                        separate the content of different web domains. It is specifically identified
                        as a threat to web browsers, since they implement the access control
                        policies that are violated in these attacks. <h:p/> 
                        Attacks which involve
                        same origin violations include: <h:ul>
                            <h:li>Insufficient protection of session tokens can lead to session
                                hijacking, where a token is captured and reused in order to gain the
                                privileges of the user who initiated the session.</h:li>
                            <h:li>XSS and CSRF
                                attacks are methods used to compromise user credentials (usually by
                                stealing the user's session token) to a website. These attacks are
                                more likely a result of server security problems, but some browsers
                                incorporate technologies that try to detect the attacks.</h:li>
                            <h:li>Inadequate sandboxing of browser windows/tabs or a faulty cross
                                domain communications model can lead to leakage of content from one
                                domain in one window/tab to a different domain in a different
                                window/tab. Such attacks leverage the ability of browsers to display
                                content from multiple domains simultaneously.</h:li>

                        <note role="application"> Web browsers implement a variety of methods to
                            ensure that the process that renders HTML and interprets JavaScript
                            operates in a constrained environment in order to reduce the risk that
                            the rendering process can be corrupted by the HTML or JavaScript it is
                            processing. This component requires the browser to lower the privileges
                            of rendering processes by ensuring that it cannot directly access the
                            file system of the host, and that it cannot use inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms provided
                            by the host to communicate with non-browser processes on the host.
                            Typically, if a rendering process needs to access a file or communicate
                            with a non-browser process, it must request such access through the
                                TSF (which is allowed by the requirement).<h:p/> In
                            addition to the two required measures, other measures can be implemented
                            depending on the browser and the host platform. These may involve such
                            actions as changing the owner of the rendering process to a
                            low-privileged account or dropping platform-defined privileges in the
                            rendering process. The ST author fills in the
                            additional measures implemented by the browser. </note>

                            <TSS>The evaluator shall examine the TSS to ensure it
                                describes how the rendering of HTML and interpretation of JavaScript
                                is performed by the browser in terms of the platform processes that
                                are involved (with "process" being an active entity that executes
                                code). For the processes that render HTML or interpret JavaScript,
                                the evaluator shall examine the TSS to check that
                                it describes how these processes are prevented from accessing the
                                platform file system. The evaluator shall check the TSS to ensure it describes each platform-provided
                                IPC mechanism, and details for each mechanism how the rendering
                                process is unable to use it to communicate with non-browser
                                processes. The evaluator shall also confirm that the TSS describes how IPC and file system access is
                                enabled (if this capability is implemented); for instance, through a
                                more privileged browser process that does not perform web page
                                rendering. The evaluator shall ensure that these descriptions are

                                    <h:li>appropriate supporting information is provided in the TSS (or pointers to such information are provided)
                                        that provides context for understanding the claimed least privilege

                                available on rendering processes. Additionally, if such mechanisms
                                are configurable (for instance, if a user can choose which
                                mechanisms to "turn on"), the evaluator shall examine the
                                operational guidance to ensure that the method for enabling and
                                disabling the mechanisms are provided, and the consequences of such

                                <note role="application"> A URL reputation service is an online service that
                                    identifies websites with malicious or phishing content applications; it
                                    is used to detect such websites prior to allowing users to access them.
                                    The goal of this requirement is to ensure that the browser is prevented
                                    from establishing connections with known-bad sources of malware on the
                                    internet. The specifics of the sequence of actions taken before a block
                                    decision is made may depend upon the specific implementation of the
                                    browser. For example, some browsers might implement the check for
                                    malicious content by checking against the list of bad URLs provided by
                                    the URL reputation service in real time; others may download updated
                                    lists of bad URLs at browser startup, updating the list periodically
                                    from the URL reputation service(s) until the browser is terminated.
                                    Ultimately, the result should be that the browser blocks the connection
                                    to the bad URL. </note>
